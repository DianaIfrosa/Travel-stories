**Android native** app built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** for storing great memories from holidays.

The main components of this app will be:   
- dashboard, where all holidays will be listed, along with their type label (family, business, romantic, solo), date, title and representative photo
- settings page, where the user has the possibility to add a PIN code to their app (like a real journal ðŸ™‚), to modify their name (for a friendly and personalized UI), to change their app theme (light/dark mode)
- add holiday page, requesting holiday details such as name, type, length, events on days, accommodation, favorite places pinned on a map, favorite photos or videos. Optional features could be an expenses calculator to keep track of the budget allocated, a possibility to choose a representative color (that will become the background color) or a section for useful links for future references
- a search bar for finding easily old trips

Technical details and aspects that I intend to use in implementation:
- local database (SQLite)
- Material 3 design components
